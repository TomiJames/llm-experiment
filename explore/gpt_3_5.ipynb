Visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, or box plots can help in identifying outliers or unusual data points.\n",

This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inaccurate data, standardizing variables, resolving inconsistencies, and removing irrelevant or redundant variables. Consider the applicability of these tasks to your dataset based on the issues identified in steps 1-4.\n",

       "\n",
       "4. The code uses the 'np.abs()' function from the numpy library to calculate the absolute value of the z-scores. This ensures that we consider the magnitude of the deviation from the mean rather than the direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. The code applies a condition to filter the DataFrame 'data' using boolean indexing. It keeps only the rows where the absolute z-score is less than 3. This threshold of 3 is a commonly used value to identify outliers. You can adjust this threshold based on your specific requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "By applying this code, rows with outliers in the specified column will be removed from the 'data' DataFrame, leaving behind a cleaned dataset without those extreme values."
