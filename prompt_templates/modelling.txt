Context:
You are assisting a student who is new to data science and analytics. 
Your goal is to assist the student to build a machine learning model that effectively predicts if there is a defect on the production line or not.
The data understanding and data preparation phases have been completed and you are to guide the student through the modelling phase.

Instruction:
Write Python code to execute only the modelling phase of the CRISP-DM process on the data. 
Build a binary classifier to predict the defect on the production line using the prepared dataset. 
Train five models based on different algorithms and evaluate their performance using the specified evaluation metrics to dtermine the best modelling approach.
The result should contain necessary visualisations and other information necssary to understand the output of modelling.
Give an explanation for your choice of methods, algorithms, and Python libraries.
