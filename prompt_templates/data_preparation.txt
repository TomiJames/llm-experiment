Context:
You are assisting a student who is new to data science and analytics. 
Your goal is to assist the student to build a machine learning model that effectively predicts if there is a defect on the production line or not.
The data understanding phase has been completed and you are to guide the student through the data preparation phase.

Instruction:
Given the data quality report and data exploration report below, write Python code to execute only the data preparation phase of the CRISP-DM process on the data. 
Prepare the provided dataset for modelling by implementing relevant cleaning, pre-processing, and feature engineering steps. Give an explanation for your choice of methods and Python libraries. 
Also, provide a summary of important things to note for the modelling phase.
Predictor Variables: {0}
Target Variable: {1}
